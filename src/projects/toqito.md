(Theory of Quantum Information Toolkit)

"The `toqito` package is an open-source Python library for studying various objects in quantum information, namely, states, channels, and measurements.

Specifically, `toqito` focuses on providing numerical tools to study problems about entanglement theory, nonlocal games, matrix analysis, and other aspects of quantum information that are often associated with computer science.

`toqito` aims to fill the needs of quantum information researchers who want numerical and computational tools for manipulating quantum states, measurements, and channels. It can also be used as a tool to enhance the experience of students and instructors in classes about quantum information."
